UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE MODULES ACTUALLY WORK

- code that is not strictly related to the route should not normally be cluttering in app.js --only routing there
- so we took out the date code and made a new file date.js and will now use it as modules
- but it is a local module hence you have to treat it that way
