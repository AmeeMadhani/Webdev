### Learning web development using the udemy course by angela yu. 
### I already know some stuff but I keep forgetting few things if I dont practice it for day.
### I think it would be better to have it stored in notes like this or have some sample code. 
### Lets go amee you can do it. I haven't seen someone as hardworking and someone turning next to impossible things possible as you.

### I am liking the consistency that I am maintaining 
### But I should not rush it.
