1. react and babel take care of all the specification and conversions needed according to the browser or conversion requirements
2. render can only take 1 element at a time..you wont be able to add h1 and p tag one after other
3. how to solve the above - just enclose them in a single div.
4. curly braces is the way to go for adding js(calling variable or any logic) in html which is in js
5. you cannot put in statements in them...only expressions are allowed inside curly braces
6. a weird syntax look at the code carefully please. some ejs templating for the same concatenation
7. adding a class for css and other changes will work but there will be a certain error. lets see what. for now know that your class and changes will be reflected like normal html file 
8. just changed it to className lol
9. you must use the closing tags in jsx but it works in html..html is forgiving, jsx does not 
10.in javascript you need to add the inline styling as javascript object
11.javascript objects exist in set of curly braces with key value pairs
12.basically adding the css styling stuff in 2 curly braces one as we are writing js in html and another as we want a js object to be passed
13.you cannot use kebbab case in js ka instyling you must use camel case
14.and the values of various changes you want to make must be inside a string no matter number or anythingg
