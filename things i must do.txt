to make sure i have a good grasp of things

1. remake the to do list website on my own without looking at anything
   I say if necessary just learn and remember while understanding like u did for your boards and every conventional exam 
   Who knows that just might be way to go 
2. try to implement removing of the items only when clicked on a button of remove. and not on reloading
3. redo the blogging website k challenges. You know you remember stuff only after you do it multiple times if not try making or cloning some other website
4. difference between nosql and sql
